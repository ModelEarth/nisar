# Earth Surface Movements

The NISAR Satellite launches June 2025 from Sriharikota, India.
<!--The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) -->

[jpl.NASA.gov](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [ISRO.gov.in](https://www.isro.gov.in/NISARSatellite.html) Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) will track tiny movements in Earth's land and ice surfaces, raising awareness of the [permanent collapse of aquifers](https://www.wired.com/story/the-ongoing-collapse-of-the-worlds-aquifers/) and identifying successful [groundwater recharging](../data-commons/docs/water/).

## EarthRider - Data Visualization Explorers

Connecting NISAR data to tools for analyzing earth surface movement. Objectives:

1. Fast loading map layers showing daily and seasonal earth surface movement to track aquifer depletion/replenishment and rainfall soil expansion/contraction.

2.  Embeddable location filters for selecting sets of countries and states for map exporations with adjacent tabulator grids for use with machine learning models.

3. Integration of the [OpenCorporates.com](https://opencorporates.com/) database to create AI training for multiple states and countries for predictive analysis and trade flow and impact map details.
